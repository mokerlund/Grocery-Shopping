####Grocery Shopping Project####

*The goal of this project is to take data from many grocery stores' weekly ads

*It will compare prices from certain dates and prices across various stores

*I want to link all of it to a database with a user-facing application to be able to look up average prices as well as to check if a price is lower or higher than usual (1st & 3rd percentiles)

Steps to build application:
1. Find APIs or data from websites to take a bunch of prices for various items
2. Gather and clean data to get ready to sort and import into database
3. Use database tools to analyze data; gather output info such as average cost per item, percentiles(is the food cheaper or more expensive than normal?), cheapest store for that item, if a coupon is associated with that item and/or store (and when it expires)
4. Create front-facing application to easily visualize items and search the database for specific items/stores/coupons
5. Maybe create shopping list out of the items and be able to add them to the cart.
6. Create a usable file of data from "purchased" items to be able to register to ***another app.
